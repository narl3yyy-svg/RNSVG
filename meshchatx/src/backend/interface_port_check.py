"""Helpers for validating that user supplied interface ports are usable.

These helpers attempt to bind to the requested port on the requested host so
that the UI can warn the operator before saving a configuration that would
fail to come up after restart. The checks are intentionally best-effort: they
only catch ports that are *currently* in use by another process, they do not
guarantee that the port will still be free at restart time.
